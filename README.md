GrowtopiaBot-Modified
an modified version of DrOreo002's Project. with MultiBot and AutoMsg fixed source by xuviuos

Usage
It should be easy to build this, but apparently visual studio wouldn't allow you to. Because sometimes thing could go wrong so I'd recommend to use Visual Studio 2019 because its the version that I'm currently using.

Change this line to whatever you want.
Build in debug mode or release.
Enjoy.
