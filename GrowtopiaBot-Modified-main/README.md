# GrowtopiaBot-Modified
an modified version of DrOreo002's Project. with MultiBot and AutoMsg.

# Usage
It should be easy to build this, but apparently visual studio wouldn't allow you to. Because sometimes thing could go wrong
so I'd recommend to use **Visual Studio 2019** because its the version that I'm currently using.

1. Change this [line](https://github.com/upyxs/GrowtopiaBot-Modified/blob/c204df8de98f4ea46d6fb6a3e2035d24739c8db8/CPPBot/CPPBot.cpp#L33) to whatever you want.
2. Build in debug mode or release.
3. Enjoy.


**Bot Data Example**

	"bot2password": "",
	"bot3username": "",
	"bot3password": "",
